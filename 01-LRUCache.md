## Explanation

The `cache` is a dictonary/map.  When the `get()` and `set()` methods are called this is a simple lookup with a key making the complexity O(1).  `recent_keys` is a queue that keeps track of the order in which the cache has been accessed; adding keys to the end of `recent_key` when the `get()` **or** `set()` methods are called, also with a complexity of O(1).  However, the function `cache` must check to see if the key is in the `recent_keys` list, making the complexity O(n).
