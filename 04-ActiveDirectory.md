## Explanation

This problem was solved recursively, visiting each group, to check if the user is in the group.  The complexity is dependent on the number of groups and the number of users.  In this case the complexity is O(g*u) where _g_ is the maxium number of groups in any given group and _u_ is the maxium number of users within any given group.
