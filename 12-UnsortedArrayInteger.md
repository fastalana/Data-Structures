## Explanation

This traverses the list once, keeping track of if the current number is larger or smaller than the stored minimum or maxium for previous values in the array.  The time complexity is O(n).  No algorithms or data structures were used to solve this problem.  Everything is done in place making the space complexity O(n), where n is the size of the original array.


* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(n)
