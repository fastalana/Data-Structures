## Explanation

To implement the Huffmann Algorithm required the construction of several classes and functions.  Each of those functions are outlined below, along with an explanation of their implementation and complexity:

* Node
* Tree
* character_frequencies
* sort_character_frequencies
* encode_tree
* insert_element_into_list
* huffman_encoding
* huffman_decoding
